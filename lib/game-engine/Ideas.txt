Particle System:

- create particles function (n, time)

- creates n amount of particles
- each particle has:
  - position (origin of particle whatever point)
  - velocity (random x, negative y)
  - velocity change (random x, positive y)
  - life span (random within time * 0.8, time * 1.2)
- particle velocity is changed by velocity change
- after time has passed, particles get deleted

maybe make it so the particles get removed at slightly different times?
