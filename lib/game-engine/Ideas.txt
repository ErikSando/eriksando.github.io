Try to re make the whole thing in Java

Text input UI

More debug functionality (different colours, life span of objects)

Multiple touch pointers so mobile games can be playable

UI that is not rendered relative to camera, for things like damage indicators

Tweening for better animations

Particle System:

- create particles function (n, time)

- creates n amount of particles
- each particle has:
  - position (origin of particle whatever point)
  - velocity (random x, negative y)
  - velocity change (random x, positive y)
  - life span (random within time * 0.8, time * 1.2)
- particle velocity is changed by velocity change
- after time has passed, particles get deleted

maybe make it so the particles get removed at slightly different times?
