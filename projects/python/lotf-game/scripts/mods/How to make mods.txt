HOW TO MAKE MODS

* If you have experience with Python, you don't need to read this unless you want ideas

Start with "import pygame, game" - this lets you run pygame stuff and access game variables

Some variables you can change:
- fps (integer)
- bg (array with 3 integers i.e. [50, 150, 250])
- screen_size (array with 2 integers i.e. [800, 500]) WARNING: editing this will make the game weird

How to edit the world/player:
- The player class takes 7 variables (x, y, sprites, defence, attack, speed, jump power). The default values
  are: x = 50, y = 50, sprites = playerSprites, defence = 100, attack = 10, speed = 5, jump power = 12
 Examples:
 - You could increase the players speed to 10 and jump power to 30 with "player = Player(50, 50, playerSprites, 100, 10, 10, 30)"
 - You could change the sprites with the following lines of code seperated with a semi-colon (;):
   import pygame, game, sprites; sprites.playerSprites = *sprites object*; game._player = Player(50, 50, playerSprites, 100, 10, 5, 12)
   The player sprites object must be formatted the same as the other sprites objects, like the following:
   sprites_object = {
       'left': {
            'idle': pygame.image.load('image path'),
            'run': [
                pygame.image.load('image path'),
                pygame.image.load('image path')
            ]
       },
       'right': {
           'idle': pygame.image.load('image path'),
           'run': [
               pygame.image.load('image path'),
               pygame.image.load('image path')
           ]
        }
    }

* If the game crashes/is frozen when you open it, you've made a mistake with the mod code.
