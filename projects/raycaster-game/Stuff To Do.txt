Split into a new project to keep the basic raycaster

Stop player from walking through walls

Add a gun in hand with animations

Add NPCs (with healthbar)

Add shooting mechanic that can kill NPCs

Make NPCs attack the player

Add a second, larger tile map for loot crates, spikes, landmines and stuff
- Rendering this stuff will just mean moving the lines down in the world so that it is on the floor and below the line of sight of the player.
- Will also need to find out how to render the top of the box (could be very difficult)

Game concept:
- Infinite wave survival of zombies or whatever the NPCs will be
- Get money from killing NPCs to buy better equipment.

And Finally:

Translate all of this into the C++ raycaster project
