HTML Design:

Start Menu:
- Select side to play
- Select difficulty
- Begin game

Two different bots:
- Player one
- Player two

* RANDOM, GENDERED NAMES FOR EACH CHARACTER TAKEN FROM SOME KIND OF DATABASE

Two seperate UIs depending on if you are player one or player two

Both UIs:
- Time available
- Cards available

Player 1 UI:
- All character information
- False information is indicated (maybe written in red?)
- Specific UI for falsifying information
- UI to tell where fake gold is planted, and where the real gold is (buried or in the thieve's house)

Player 2 UI:
- All information gathered (thief information, character information, gold located, gold verified)
- Information that has been verified as false is either indicated (maybe written in red?) or changed (i.e. 'has' is replaced with 'does not have')

For now, the webpage will start by asking if the user wants to play as the thief or the detective
The opponent will be a computer, with variable difficulty

Difficulty ratings:

Easy:
- Makes completely random choices

Medium:
- Can not use guess thief card until close to the end
- Uses up as much time balance as possible

Hard:
- Makes logically perfect choices (or as close as I can program it)
- Only uses guess thief cards once all other cards are used up (to maximise information)



Some things I want to add:
- You select cards to play, and the time balance changes accordingly
- You press a confirm button to play the cards
- You can play more cards if you still have the time available. This allows you to change what you play depending on feedback from the card just played.

- Duplicate cards are stacked on each other to save space
