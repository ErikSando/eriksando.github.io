shithead card game (a.k.a. palace i think)

Each player starts with:
3 cards placed face down (hidden palace).
3 cards placed face up on top of the face down cards (other players can see, upper palace).
3 cards in hand.

Can swap any card in upper palace with face up cards at the start of the game.

Must have at least 3 cards in hand at all times (unless there are no cards to pick up).
Pick up a card (or multiple if multiple cards are played) after each turn.

The face up cards are played once the player runs out of cards.

The face down cards are played once the player runs out of face up cards.

Player with lowest card goes first.

Every next card played must be higher than the last.
Order of cards: 
- 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, J, Q, K, A, magic cards
Order of suites
- clubs, spades, diamonds, hearts
Ace is highest.

Special cards:
7  - next card must be lower (can be another 7 if the suite is lower)
8  - skip (3+ players)
9  - reverse (3+ players)

Magic cards:
2  - reset (any card can be played on top)
10 - clear stack

If 4 cards of the same number are played consecutively, the stack is cleared.

Once all of a player's cards are gone, they win.
